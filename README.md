# Cisco_Stock_Price_Data_Project
Personal Project for Data Analyst Portfolio - Partha Rana 

Below is the gameplan, what I learned, and a to-do section for this project. 
 

notes on dataset from kaggle:

6 cols ,> 8000 rows
columns:
datetime - date format
open - price at opening
high - max price at opening
low - lowest price during time period
close - price at market close
%change - open price to close price



Gameplan for Project 1: excel -> python -> sql -> tableau
---cisco stock price dataset: (excel, python, sql, tableau, PowerBI)
what i did so far:
⦁	downloaded data, cleaned data in excel, organized data and made notes in notepad
⦁	transferred revised excel file in jupyter notebook - for python code
⦁	refined data again using python in jn
⦁	formatted data for MySQL queries
⦁	imported stock price data excel sheet csv format to MySQL workbench
⦁	ran multiple queries to learn more about cisco as a company and its history




what i learned:
⦁	excel column names must be in compliance with python and MySQL column name rules
 	-which means column names in 1 word and no special characters
⦁	cisco was the essential backbone for the booming internet in the year 2000
 	-that is why stock price was max in 2000 - 81.44



to do:
⦁	download csv file for cisco stock price data from Kaggle
⦁	clean, sort, format data
⦁	upload to jupyter lab and notebook for further cleaning and formatting
⦁	run pandas and numpy queries to understand and analyze data
⦁	visualize data via matplotlib python library and chart data
⦁	upload csv data file for cisco stock price to MySQL workbench
⦁	write sql queries to answer unique questions
 	-and find out more about cisco just from sql (check what i learned section)
⦁	visualize data in sql
⦁	visualize data in tableau and PowerBI
⦁	add GitHub page for project and explain it, updated accordingly to portfolio website / resume
 	-add readme file in GitHub
 	-upload excel sheet for stock data
 	-download python code from jn and upload proper .py file for python code
 	-upload .sql file in GitHub as a file
